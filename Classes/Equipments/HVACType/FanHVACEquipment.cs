It draws air from the air handling unit (AHU) or ductwork and supplies it to the rooms or zones that require heating, cooling, or ventilation." +
                    "\r\n\r\nHere are some key points about supply fans:" +
                    "\r\n\r\n1. **Air Distribution**: The primary function of a supply fan is to distribute conditioned air throughout a building. It creates positive pressure within the ductwork, pushing air out and delivering it to the supply ducts that branch off to individual rooms or zones." +
                    "\r\n\r\n2. **Air Velocity and Pressure**: Supply fans generate a sufficient velocity and pressure to overcome the resistance in the ductwork and deliver the desired amount of air to the occupied spaces. The size and power of the fan are determined by factors such as the airflow requirements, system design, and the length and complexity of the ductwork." +
                    "\r\n\r\n3. **Types of Supply Fans**: Supply fans can be classified into different types based on their design and application. Some common types include centrifugal fans, axial fans, and mixed flow fans.
